# RaiseUp 

### Fundraising Inspiration Platform for Charities

###### Introduction

RaiseUp is a platform created by Cameron Skene and Thomas Thurmer which provides (Australian) charities the ability to share their fundraising campaigns and search for inspiration for their next fundraising or marketing efforts. 

Live version: www.raise-up.co 

###### Instructions

The left-hand column displays charities represented in the database. Choose a search query type from the dropdown menu listed "Search by" and enter a query into the search field. Click search and the charities with campaigns or materials which match the search criteria will be displayed. Click on a campaign in the middle column to access its materials on the right, and then click on the desired material for a close up view.

###### Development History

RaiseUp was developed by Cameron Skene over a week and a half as the final project for the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp in Berlin, Germany. The charities, campaigns and materials on the platform have been sourced by Thomas Thurmer from his work as a fundraising manager for a major charity in Australia.

###### Tech Stack

RaiseUp was built with the MERN stack -- React.js and Reactstrap for frontend, MongoDB and Express.js for backend. It uses Cloudinary for image upload and hosting services. 

###### Development Status

RaiseUp is currently an early stage prototype and will be growing over the next few months as we move towards launch for the Australian NFP sector. Sorry for the bugs!
