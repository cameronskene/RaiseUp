In other words we believe that most people have the ability to overcome whatever it is they are dealing with. Given the right support, the right opportunities and chances, most people have the ability to make positive change in their lives â and achieve a better future for themselves and their families.\n      \n      2) We give people a hand up\n      \n      We offer resources and choices that open up opportunities and build independence. Itâs about providing the right support at the right time, so those living with deep disadvantage and exclusion can make positive change in their lives.\n      \n      3) We are inclusive\n      \n      We respect the beliefs of all those we work with; we include everyone regardless of their background, socio-economic status or country of origin; and we are supportive of cultural heritage. While we respect these beliefs and backgrounds and work hard to accommodate everyone at every turn, our focus is very much on a personâs welfare, their future and what we can offer to contribute to this.\n      Our Goals\n      \n      At Melbourne City Mission, we have bold ambitions to make an even bigger difference. By 2022, we aim to double our size and double our impact. Weâll be changing many more lives in many more places to meet increasing demand for social services.
